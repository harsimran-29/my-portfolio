    <h1>The Best Movies According to Harsimran</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Titanic</h3>
    <p>This is my favourite hollywood movie. There's love and romance, of course, since the central plot is the love story between Jack and Rose. Then we have tragedyâ€”since, you know, the boat sinks and lots of people die</p>

    <h3>Drishyam</h3>
    <p>It is Indian crime thriller movie full of action and mystery. It has themes of sexual harassment, murder and violent scenes.</p>
